# wayland-switch
Tool for wayland that allows to open an application or bring it to front if already running.

This feature is available for X with tools like [xdotool](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/) or [wmctrl](http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl/) but nothing seems to be around for wayland. This repo is an attempt to fill this gap.
